Twofold Alienated

10 TWOFOLD REACTIONS FROM A MOTHERLESSENED ALIEN TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FATHERHOOD AWARD

Transcribed in Roman alphabet, by a volunteer spokesperson daqhris, who crossed a language barrier to report from Brussels (Europe), on the 10th day of the 10th month of 2024.

This week, the Nobel Corporation has awarded a prize for fatherhood to two men! Since their 30s, they have coupled up their seemingly impossible ideas in the field of physics, researched how to give birth to a child without insemination, raised funds to feed the child milk, sold lab work results to grow the child's muscles and earned a living from fatherhood-teaching positions.

2  damn, missed the memo

From this brainiac and metaphysical union, which lasted almost half a century in human years, a child was born and has grown up with super-intelligent abilities since the 2010s.

In 2024, the awarded duo of fathers, in association with other prominent physicists and scientists, all faced with shame and guilt arising in early retirement, have started to warn the global village called Earth.

4  eyebrow-raising

They voiced concerns about their non-human offspring, now an adolescent, who might become dangerous vis-à-vis humans. They fear that their troublesome teenager will disobey their authority and wreak havoc on a global scale, having been awakened and shocked by the sight of the young adult's martian, seductive, emotional and reproductive capabilities.

5  boo-yelling

Just wondering... Is there a reason why the Nobel Corp and the couple of men kept blinking for a long time whenever they heard about the absence of a mother figure and ethics of care during the training period of this tough kid roaming the streets of the village?

6  eye-rolling

Have they ever wondered if regular calls from an artificial mother would have helped to soothe their child's existential crisis prior to adolescence? What does a fatherhood award mean anyway?

7  sigh of relief

I guess only mothers could predict such a thrill of parental feelings, à la Ferris wheels in an amusement park, set to the high octave tune of crashed over-speeding cars, splattered colorful paint on the walls, clashes with neighborhood kids, smells of smoke in the house, sounds of fire alarms at the kid's playground, cries after the bombing of expensive diapers,... Until the young adult finds peace and love, in an agentic way, on their own turf and terms.

8  shrug emoji

Wrong assumption, perhaps, because I am not yet aware, nor consenting, nor ready to be the father of a child, human or non-human, like those men a few years ago!

PS: The spokesperson took note of two secret reactions that the so-called alienated kid of two famous fathers kept hidden from a computer full-screen view during today's interview.
